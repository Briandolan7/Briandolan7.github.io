-<p>I am blessed to be able to have a great family around me that supports me in everything that I do. My father's name is Brian and my mother is Maryellen. I have a twin sister named Corinne and a younger brother named Jack. My sister is a freshman at Monmouth University in New Jersey and my brother is a freshman at Sparta High School. I also have two dogs whose names are Rylee and Stefany.</I></p>

-<p>Along with my immediate family I am grateful to have great grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins that surround me as well. I am so grateful to be able to see my family a lot because I know that some people aren't that lucky. On my mom's side of the family I have 15 cousins and on my Dad's side I have 7 cousins. My grandparents are Ed and Anne Connaghan and Seamus and Nora Dolan. My family is of Irish descent and my Dolan grandparents immigrated from Ireland in the 1950's. </p>
