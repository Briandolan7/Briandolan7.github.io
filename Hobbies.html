<h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
    <h3>Sports</h3>
<p>Sports has always been a big part of my life, and they continue to be to this day. I always loved the competition aspect of sports and that there is always a winner and a loser. Football is the sport that I have the most passion for, and it is the sport that I continue to work hard in today. People always say that football players are just dumb jocks but that could not be farther from the case. Many people don't realize how smart you have to be in football in order to know the plays, coverages, fronts, blocking concepts. Football is not just a game where you tackle and hit each other, it teaches you about life. I have also played basketball, baseball and competed in Track and Field.</p>
    <h3>Academics</h3>
<p>I know that when many people see me they immediately think that I am a dumb "jock" but that could not be farther from the case. I love going to school and receiving a education, I always have. One of my favorite things to do even from a young age was Math. I loved the fact that there was one set answer out there and how straight forward it is. My love for math has driven me to pursue a degree in Finance and a Minor in Accounting.  </p>
    <h3>Fishing</h3>
<p>Ever since a young age when my Grandpa put a fishing pole in my hands at his lake house I have been a avid fisherman. Anytime I can find a time to cast a line (weather permitting) I do so. Me and my friends have been on a couple deep sea fishing trips as of late, fishing for Flounder and Tuna. I will definitely have to take advantage of the great fishing here in Maine while I am up here! </T></p>
    <h3>Music</h3>
<p>I absolutely love music. I do not know how I would live without it to be honest. I love how music can be emotional, motivating, or funny. I love all different kids of music as well, however Country and Rap have to be my favorite. In the summertime I love going to concerts and having a good time. </p>
