<h1>Fun Facts</h1>
<P>Me, my sister and my dad all have the same birthdays- 12/29, I have two labrador retrievers, I went to school and played on the same sports teams my whole life with my cousin Matt. This year is the first year me and my sister are not in school together. I have lived in the same house my whole life. I went to a private high school in my hometown. I had to share a car with my sister throughout High School.  </P>
